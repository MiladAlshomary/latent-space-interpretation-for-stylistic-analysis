The two opponents keep guessing the coordinates till one player loses all his ships. When a player lost all his ships, the other player wins the game.\\n\\n  Battleship will not make a good recommendation to people looking for game that can get them engaged in thinking and doing some calculations.

       "      <td>Checkers dates back to ancient time, back to around 3000BC. Some ancient checkerboards measuring 5×5 in British museum, so the game is not a new age board game.\\n\\n  The present age board game varies from 8×8, 10×10 to 12×12 based on the different variations of the game. The most popular Checkers is the American Checkers, also called English Draughts, it measures 8×8 and popular mostly among English speaking nations.\\n\\n  Checkers is a 2 players game and all that is needed to play a Checkers board game is the Checkerboard and pieces (2 sets; a dark and a light sets of pieces). On the checkerboard, the dark squares are used for play, the pieces move diagonally to empty square and the opponents are that target in order to win the game.\\n\\n  In Checkers, capturing; elimination of opponent's pieces from the board is the way to win and this is achieved when a player's piece is able to jump diagonally over an opponent's piece to the next empty square after the one where the opponent's piece is located. A piece can capture more than one piece in a move provided there are chances to do so. In the game, pieces can only move forward; no backward movement.\\n\\n  In a situation where a player did not capture his opponent's piece that's open to be captured and the opponent did the capturing by himself, that's a penalty (Muffin) and if there occur 2 or more Muffins, there is forfeit of other pieces and that's a lose to the player.\\n\\n  In Checkers, pieces are also called men and when a piece has moved to the farthest distance in the board, it becomes a king. The king is identified by its crown. Crowning is done by placing another piece on the king. A king has a super power, it can move forward and backward, it can capture opponent's piece from any distance and it can also capture multiple pieces in just one move.\\n\\n  Checkers is a good indoor and outdoor game, flexible to move around. It is easy to play but requires strategic planning and calculation to know when to move a piece and how not to become prey to the opponent's pieces.\\n\\n  Checkers is a good avenue to network, make friends and meet like minds. It's a game for all; young and old, men and women, black and white.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The life board game is classified as a family game, it is about living and planning a life on the game board; choosing a career path, paying bills, taking care of responsibilities and more. Life is a good fun game among adults who knows what taking responsibilities looks like in reality and an educative one for young one who are always curious about growing older; life gives them a feel of what to expect when they grow up.\\n\\n  To play the game, a special 3D game board designed as a track similar to a real-life journey. Every movement through the track is about expectations, duties, life investment and bills paying, something that makes the game has the feel of reality. Aside the game board, a spinner wheel, stack of play money, insurance policies and bank loans, 25 life tiles, deck of 36 cards, a banker's tray, 6 car pawns, blue and pink people pegs and the game rules and instructions make up the Life board game components.\\n\\n  Playing the game is a as simple as following the game track but the idea behind the game has a level of complexity; a real-life rule isn't a simple thing to get about. The game isn't about competition or conquering like some board games, it's just about each player walking their separate life journey. The winner is decided among the players at the end of every player's life journey (at retirement) by calculating their worth; the one with the most net worth wins the game.\\n\\n  At start, the game board and other components are set; the life tiles are shuffled, placed facing down. After shuffling, 4 random tiles are drawn out and placed on the millionaire estate. The cards are separated into four decks; career life cards, salary life cards, house deeds life cards and stock cards. The other piles are the insurance policies and bank loans, place everything near the game board, select a player as the banker to monitor game money.\\n\\n  After the game setup, all players take turns spinning the spinner wheel, the player with the highest spin is the first to start the journey, the other players follow in a clockwise movement of how the players sit next to each other. A player can either start on the career lane; gets $10,000 for start or on the college lane; takes $40,000 college loans.\\n\\n  Starting on a career lane, a player is expected to draw a career tile and a salary tile, the player will have to redraw a career tile if the first career tile drawn requires a degree certificate. After drawing the tiles, the player spin again to start the life journey. For a player on the college lane, all that is required is to take a college loan ($40,000) after which the player spin the wheel and journey through the life lane on regular turns.\\n\\n  The game track is divided into four spaces; the orange spaces, the green spaces, the blue spaces and the red spaces. When a player lands on each space, he/she read the instructions on the space to know what is expected of him/her.\\n\\n  The green spaces indicate PAY DAY, when a player pass through these spaces, the bank pays the player's salary. There are just three red spaces on the life track; Job Search, buy a House and Get Married. The blue spaces are optional, a player can neglect directives on the blue spaces. The orange spaces have most spaces on the game track, when you land on any orange space, it is a most that you follow the directives on the space.\\n\\n  On the orange spaces, there are life spaces, career spaces, tax due spaces, police officer rule, changing career spaces, Babies spaces and the retire space. All these spaces have tasks, information that every play that land or pass through them are expected to carry out. The game rules and regulations are available to guide activities throughout the game.\\n\\n  At retirement, every player is expected to settle all loans and choose where to retire, either at the millionaire estates or at the countryside acres. For players that retires at the millionaire estates, the player with highest amount of money at retirement is entitled to the four life tiles drawn and placed on the millionaire estates from the start of the game (when there is a tie, the tiles are shared between the players).\\n\\n  After all the players have retired, their wealth’s are added up (amount of money and value of all the life tiles the player has) and the one with the highest net worth wins the game.\\n\\n  Life is a good game for career and life decision making, it can help young minds to have a feel of what to expect and what' expected of them as they grow older. Life is dynamic like reality.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Risk is a classic board game that requires strategy and risk taking to play. It is a game with a goal; to conquer other opponent's territories.\\n\\n  To play Risk, a special game board is needed; the game board is a map of the six continents divided into territories (42). Other objects needed for the game set up are 40 infantry (armies), 12 cavalry (1 cavalry is equal 5 infantry), 8 Artillery (an Artillery is equivalent to 10 Infantry), Dice; 3 red dice, two white dice, the game guide and a deck of 56 risk cards (due to variation in versions of the game, the number of risk cards are not always the same). The Risk game can be played by 2-6 players, the expected age range of player is 10 years old and above.\\n\\n  To start, the armies are shared among the players as a starting troop and to determine who takes turn first, each player roll a die and the player with the highest roll emerge as the first player and the arrangement of who plays next follows a clockwise movement from the first player.\\n\\n  The players are expected to keep occupying territories with their armies till all the territories are occupied, the main goal of the game is for a player to take over the world by eliminating all the opponents by conquering their territories, this is achieved by attacking other players' neighboring territories till all territories on the map are occupied by a player's armies.\\n\\n  Risk game requires a lot of strategic planning in building territories, conquering opponents and winning the game. It takes a lot of calculations and time; an average game will last 1-2hours but on some occasions, player can save time by using Secret Mission, each player has a secret mission, the first player to achieve his secret mission wins the game.\\n\\n  The game has rules guiding it, before starting the game, players should check the game rules as there are variation in game rules by version/ producer. It is more strategic to take control of smaller continents at the beginning of the game in order to have stronger territories rather than take control of larger continents like Asia where there will be spread of armies with weaker territories.\\n\\n  To attack an opponent, the player in turn makes a verbal statement of attack on the opponent territory he wants to attack; I'll attack territory Q from territory D. Attacks are best possible when the territory to be attacked is adjacent to the territory where the attack will be launched. A player can attack a territory with a territory that is not adjacent only when all the territories between the two territories are under the control of the attacker. The player in play can attack as many times as possible during his turn, he keeps attacking till he drops the dice, indicating the end of his attack and turn.\\n\\n  When launching an attack, it is best that the territory where the attack will be launched has a strong territory before deciding on launching the attack. An attacker has the privilege to engage a maximum of 3 armies in an attack provided that he has at least an armies left, not engaged in the attack as a backup army should in case he lost in the attack, he just loses armies and not his territory. The defender can engage a maximum of 2 armies to defend his territory and keeping at least a backup army too.\\n\\n  The attack is executed between the attacker and the defender using dice throw, the attacker rolls the red dice while the defender rolls the white. The highest number obtained by each player are compared; the attacker's highest roll against the defender's highest roll. After the first highest, the second highest are compared too. The attacker wins when his highest rolls are more than the defender's rolls but in case the defender has better dice roll or there is a tie, the attacker loses his armies and that territory where the attack came from becomes a weaker territory and an attack on such territory might cost the occupier the loss of the territory and territory risk cards attached to the territory.\\n\\n  While players take turns in the game, they have chances to strengthen their territories; fortification of territories. This help build stronger territories that are not prone to attack and a strong army good for a conquering mission.\\n\\n  Players get additional armies at every round of turns based on the number of territories they occupy (calculated as no of territories ÷ 3). The players can also exchange their risk cards for armies; a set of three different risk card, three same risk cards or two the same risk cards and a wild card can be exchange for armies. The number of armies a player get in the exchange increases with set: First set: 4 troops, second set: 6 troops, third set: 8 troops, fourth set: 10 troops, fifth set: 15 troops after the fifth set, there is addition of 5 armies to the number from the previous set.\\n\\n  Players also get additional armies on the number of continents they control at every new round of turns; a number of armies is fixed to a continent; this can be found in the legend (on the game board).</td>\n",

       "      <td>It is an interesting, complex, and challenging board game that combines a clever blend of territory control and science fiction. You are the leader of a faction that occupies one of seven distinct categories of planets. Before others do, you must terraform nearby planets into your home habitats in order to thrive and grow.\\n\\n  In Gaia Project, you lead a faction of your own creation. This is one of the few space-themed games that I have ever played where I didn't feel like I was roleplaying as an alien creature or battling space monsters. Instead I found myself in charge of my own empire and trying to take over the planet with my allies through aggressive campaigns and clever tactics. The game can be played with up to four people, but we tended to fight with only two players because there are so many ways for players to influence each other during their turns that there just aren't enough turns for everyone to act simultaneously before someone makes some bad decisions or performs poorly in diplomacy/relation building/whatever else happens during a turn.\\n\\n  Gameplay and Replay Value\\n\\n  Gaia Project is a board game that can be played by 1 to 4 players or in teams of up to three. Each player will take on the role of an eco-predator that has survived long enough to claim a piece of land. Players move around the board and battle other players, using their tools (tools used during gameplay) and advantages such as tree cover, fog, and wind.\\n\\n  The gameplay is quite simple, but still fun. The gameplay of Gaia Project is a board game that features both solo and multiplayer play. The aim of the game is to collect as many crystals as possible by placing them on your growing crystal garden (or \"terrarium\") while also protecting it from being taken over by hostile forces. There are four different types of enemy units in the game, each with its own unique characteristics: fast runners, strong waves of weaker creatures, infested wall surfaces and walls with openings within them. Additionally, it is easy to imagine the game being able to be played with friends in real life. The replay value is high as each turn can have many strategic possibilities that are all dependent on how you play your cards, who else has cards in their hands, etc.\\n\\n  Aesthetics\\n\\n  The aesthetics are great, the board game comes with a box that makes it look very high-end. The game can also be played with as few as 2 players but it works best with 4 or more. It has lots of replay value because there are different ways to play each level depending on what actions your opponents take on the board. The biggest pro is that it teaches how to share resources between the different people in your group, so if you plan on making a long term social app or something like that in the future this would be super helpful for learning how to code together.</td>\n",

Each player takes turn in guessing the coordinate where the opponent's ships are been hid, when a player get the coordinate right, the opponent's ship is sunk and the grid where the ship is placed is marked with a white peg, the player in play also mark his tracking lane with white peg.\\n\\n  On the other hand, id the coordinate is wrong, the player marks his tracking lane with white peg while the opponent marks the guessed grid (by the player in play) with a red peg.

Some ancient checkerboards measuring 5×5 in British museum, so the game is not a new age board game.\\n\\n  The present age board game varies from 8×8, 10×10 to 12×12 based on the different variations of the game. The most popular Checkers is the American Checkers, also called English Draughts, it measures 8×8 and popular mostly among English speaking nations.\\n\\n  Checkers is a 2 players game and all that is needed to play a Checkers board game is the Checkerboard and pieces (2 sets; a dark and a light sets of pieces). On the checkerboard, the dark squares are used for play, the pieces move diagonally to empty square and the opponents are that target in order to win the game.\\n\\n  In Checkers, capturing; elimination of opponent's pieces from the board is the way to win and this is achieved when a player's piece is able to jump diagonally over an opponent's piece to the next empty square after the one where the opponent's piece is located. A piece can capture more than one piece in a move provided there are chances to do so. In the game, pieces can only move forward; no backward movement.\\n\\n  In a situation where a player did not capture his opponent's piece that's open to be captured and the opponent did the capturing by himself, that's a penalty (Muffin) and if there occur 2 or more Muffins, there is forfeit of other pieces and that's a lose to the player.\\n\\n  In Checkers, pieces are also called men and when a piece has moved to the farthest distance in the board, it becomes a king. The king is identified by its crown. Crowning is done by placing another piece on the king. A king has a super power, it can move forward and backward, it can capture opponent's piece from any distance and it can also capture multiple pieces in just one move.\\n\\n  Checkers is a good indoor and outdoor game, flexible to move around. It is easy to play but requires strategic planning and calculation to know when to move a piece and how not to become prey to the opponent's pieces.\\n\\n  Checkers is a good avenue to network, make friends and meet like minds. It's a game for all; young and old, men and women, black and white.   \n",

Life is a good fun game among adults who knows what taking responsibilities looks like in reality and an educative one for young one who are always curious about growing older; life gives them a feel of what to expect when they grow up.\\n\\n  To play the game, a special 3D game board designed as a track similar to a real-life journey. Every movement through the track is about expectations, duties, life investment and bills paying, something that makes the game has the feel of reality. Aside the game board, a spinner wheel, stack of play money, insurance policies and bank loans, 25 life tiles, deck of 36 cards, a banker's tray, 6 car pawns, blue and pink people pegs and the game rules and instructions make up the Life board game components.\\n\\n  Playing the game is a as simple as following the game track but the idea behind the game has a level of complexity; a real-life rule isn't a simple thing to get about. The game isn't about competition or conquering like some board games, it's just about each player walking their separate life journey. The winner is decided among the players at the end of every player's life journey (at retirement) by calculating their worth; the one with the most net worth wins the game.\\n\\n  At start, the game board and other components are set; the life tiles are shuffled, placed facing down. After shuffling, 4 random tiles are drawn out and placed on the millionaire estate. The cards are separated into four decks; career life cards, salary life cards, house deeds life cards and stock cards. The other piles are the insurance policies and bank loans, place everything near the game board, select a player as the banker to monitor game money.\\n\\n  After the game setup, all players take turns spinning the spinner wheel, the player with the highest spin is the first to start the journey, the other players follow in a clockwise movement of how the players sit next to each other. A player can either start on the career lane; gets $10,000 for start or on the college lane; takes $40,000 college loans.\\n\\n  Starting on a career lane, a player is expected to draw a career tile and a salary tile, the player will have to redraw a career tile if the first career tile drawn requires a degree certificate. After drawing the tiles, the player spin again to start the life journey. For a player on the college lane, all that is required is to take a college loan ($40,000) after which the player spin the wheel and journey through the life lane on regular turns.\\n\\n  The game track is divided into four spaces; the orange spaces, the green spaces, the blue spaces and the red spaces. When a player lands on each space, he/she read the instructions on the space to know what is expected of him/her.\\n\\n  The green spaces indicate PAY DAY, when a player pass through these spaces, the bank pays the player's salary. There are just three red spaces on the life track; Job Search, buy a House and Get Married. The blue spaces are optional, a player can neglect directives on the blue spaces. The orange spaces have most spaces on the game track, when you land on any orange space, it is a most that you follow the directives on the space.\\n\\n  On the orange spaces, there are life spaces, career spaces, tax due spaces, police officer rule, changing career spaces, Babies spaces and the retire space. All these spaces have tasks, information that every play that land or pass through them are expected to carry out. The game rules and regulations are available to guide activities throughout the game.\\n\\n  At retirement, every player is expected to settle all loans and choose where to retire, either at the millionaire estates or at the countryside acres. For players that retires at the millionaire estates, the player with highest amount of money at retirement is entitled to the four life tiles drawn and placed on the millionaire estates from the start of the game (when there is a tie, the tiles are shared between the players).\\n\\n  After all the players have retired, their wealth’s are added up (amount of money and value of all the life tiles the player has) and the one with the highest net worth wins the game.\\n\\n  Life is a good game for career and life decision making, it can help young minds to have a feel of what to expect and what' expected of them as they grow older. Life is dynamic like reality.   \n",
       "3  Risk is a classic board game that requires strategy and risk taking to play. It is a game with a goal; to conquer other opponent's territories.\\n\\n  To play Risk, a special game board is needed; the game board is a map of the six continents divided into territories (42). Other objects needed for the game set up are 40 infantry (armies), 12 cavalry (1 cavalry is equal 5 infantry), 8 Artillery (an Artillery is equivalent to 10 Infantry), Dice; 3 red dice, two white dice, the game guide and a deck of 56 risk cards (due to variation in versions of the game, the number of risk cards are not always the same). The Risk game can be played by 2-6 players, the expected age range of player is 10 years old and above.\\n\\n  To start, the armies are shared among the players as a starting troop and to determine who takes turn first, each player roll a die and the player with the highest roll emerge as the first player and the arrangement of who plays next follows a clockwise movement from the first player.\\n\\n  The players are expected to keep occupying territories with their armies till all the territories are occupied, the main goal of the game is for a player to take over the world by eliminating all the opponents by conquering their territories, this is achieved by attacking other players' neighboring territories till all territories on the map are occupied by a player's armies.\\n\\n  Risk game requires a lot of strategic planning in building territories, conquering opponents and winning the game. It takes a lot of calculations and time; an average game will last 1-2hours but on some occasions, player can save time by using Secret Mission, each player has a secret mission, the first player to achieve his secret mission wins the game.\\n\\n  The game has rules guiding it, before starting the game, players should check the game rules as there are variation in game rules by version/ producer. It is more strategic to take control of smaller continents at the beginning of the game in order to have stronger territories rather than take control of larger continents like Asia where there will be spread of armies with weaker territories.\\n\\n  To attack an opponent, the player in turn makes a verbal statement of attack on the opponent territory he wants to attack; I'll attack territory Q from territory D. Attacks are best possible when the territory to be attacked is adjacent to the territory where the attack will be launched. A player can attack a territory with a territory that is not adjacent only when all the territories between the two territories are under the control of the attacker. The player in play can attack as many times as possible during his turn, he keeps attacking till he drops the dice, indicating the end of his attack and turn.\\n\\n  When launching an attack, it is best that the territory where the attack will be launched has a strong territory before deciding on launching the attack. An attacker has the privilege to engage a maximum of 3 armies in an attack provided that he has at least an armies left, not engaged in the attack as a backup army should in case he lost in the attack, he just loses armies and not his territory. The defender can engage a maximum of 2 armies to defend his territory and keeping at least a backup army too.\\n\\n  The attack is executed between the attacker and the defender using dice throw, the attacker rolls the red dice while the defender rolls the white. The highest number obtained by each player are compared; the attacker's highest roll against the defender's highest roll. After the first highest, the second highest are compared too. The attacker wins when his highest rolls are more than the defender's rolls but in case the defender has better dice roll or there is a tie, the attacker loses his armies and that territory where the attack came from becomes a weaker territory and an attack on such territory might cost the occupier the loss of the territory and territory risk cards attached to the territory.\\n\\n  While players take turns in the game, they have chances to strengthen their territories; fortification of territories. This help build stronger territories that are not prone to attack and a strong army good for a conquering mission.\\n\\n  Players get additional armies at every round of turns based on the number of territories they occupy (calculated as no of territories ÷ 3). The players can also exchange their risk cards for armies; a set of three different risk card, three same risk cards or two the same risk cards and a wild card can be exchange for armies. The number of armies a player get in the exchange increases with set: First set: 4 troops, second set: 6 troops, third set: 8 troops, fourth set: 10 troops, fifth set: 15 troops after the fifth set, there is addition of 5 armies to the number from the previous set.\\n\\n  Players also get additional armies on the number of continents they control at every new round of turns; a number of armies is fixed to a continent; this can be found in the legend (on the game board).   \n",

You are the leader of a faction that occupies one of seven distinct categories of planets. Before others do, you must terraform nearby planets into your home habitats in order to thrive and grow.\\n\\n  In Gaia Project, you lead a faction of your own creation. This is one of the few space-themed games that I have ever played where I didn't feel like I was roleplaying as an alien creature or battling space monsters. Instead I found myself in charge of my own empire and trying to take over the planet with my allies through aggressive campaigns and clever tactics. The game can be played with up to four people, but we tended to fight with only two players because there are so many ways for players to influence each other during their turns that there just aren't enough turns for everyone to act simultaneously before someone makes some bad decisions or performs poorly in diplomacy/relation building/whatever else happens during a turn.\\n\\n  Gameplay and Replay Value\\n\\n  Gaia Project is a board game that can be played by 1 to 4 players or in teams of up to three. Each player will take on the role of an eco-predator that has survived long enough to claim a piece of land. Players move around the board and battle other players, using their tools (tools used during gameplay) and advantages such as tree cover, fog, and wind.\\n\\n  The gameplay is quite simple, but still fun. The gameplay of Gaia Project is a board game that features both solo and multiplayer play. The aim of the game is to collect as many crystals as possible by placing them on your growing crystal garden (or \"terrarium\") while also protecting it from being taken over by hostile forces. There are four different types of enemy units in the game, each with its own unique characteristics: fast runners, strong waves of weaker creatures, infested wall surfaces and walls with openings within them. Additionally, it is easy to imagine the game being able to be played with friends in real life. The replay value is high as each turn can have many strategic possibilities that are all dependent on how you play your cards, who else has cards in their hands, etc.\\n\\n  Aesthetics\\n\\n  The aesthetics are great, the board game comes with a box that makes it look very high-end. The game can also be played with as few as 2 players but it works best with 4 or more. It has lots of replay value because there are different ways to play each level depending on what actions your opponents take on the board. The biggest pro is that it teaches how to share resources between the different people in your group, so if you plan on making a long term social app or something like that in the future this would be super helpful for learning how to code together.   \n",
