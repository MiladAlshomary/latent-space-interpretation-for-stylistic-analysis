       "      <td>Bic Erasable Pens, twelve pack, variety assortment\\n\\nThe fluidity of writing with a pen makes it significantly more desirable to grab a pen rather than a pencil; however, when writing with a pen, you run the risk of making a mistake that cannot be erased. Then you are dealing with starting fresh or the ever-frustrating scribble marks left behind. The solution? Erasable pens. Erasable pens provide the ease and aesthetic of writing with a pen, but with the added convenience of an eraser in case of a mistake. Bic erasable pens come in a twelve pack assortment, with colors like black, purple, red, and orange. Due to the nature of the product, the pens are at an increased likelihood of bleeding when paper becomes wet.</td>\n",

Then you are dealing with starting fresh or the ever-frustrating scribble marks left behind. The solution? Erasable pens. Erasable pens provide the ease and aesthetic of writing with a pen, but with the added convenience of an eraser in case of a mistake. Bic erasable pens come in a twelve pack assortment, with colors like black, purple, red, and orange. Due to the nature of the product, the pens are at an increased likelihood of bleeding when paper becomes wet.   \n",
