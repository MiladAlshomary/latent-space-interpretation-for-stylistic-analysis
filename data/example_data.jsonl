The Starks are all about honor and duty, but their loyalty often lands them in hot water. Meanwhile, the Lannisters are scheming and always seem to be a few steps ahead, thanks to their motto, \"A Lannister always pays his debts.\" Then there's Daenerys with her three dragons, trying to break chains and reclaim the Iron Throne. The political intrigue, backstabbing, and epic battles keep you on the edge of your seat, making it one heck of a wild ride through the Seven Kingdoms.","languages":["en"],"lengthWords":106}
{"documentID":"document_2","authorSetIDs":["author_2"],"fullText":"In classical mechanics, Newton's second law of motion is a fundamental principle that describes the relationship between the force applied to an object and its resulting acceleration. This law is succinctly expressed by the equation:\n\n\\[ F = ma \\]\n\nwhere \\( F \\) represents the force applied to the object, \\( m \\) denotes the mass of the object, and \\( a \\) is the acceleration produced.\n\nTo elaborate, force (\\( F \\)) is a vector quantity that causes an object to change its velocity, hence producing acceleration (\\( a \\)). The mass (\\( m \\)) is a scalar quantity that quantifies the amount of matter in the object. According to Newton's second law, the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass. Thus, if the same force is applied to two objects of different masses, the object with the smaller mass will experience a greater acceleration.\n\nConsider an example where a force of 10 Newtons is applied to a mass of 2 kilograms. Using Newton's second law, the acceleration can be calculated as follows:\n\n\\[ a = \\frac{F}{m} = \\frac{10 \\, \\text{N}}{2 \\, \\text{kg}} = 5 \\, \\text{m/s}^2 \\]\n\nThis result indicates that the object will accelerate at a rate of \\( 5 \\, \\text{m/s}^2 \\) under the influence of the given force. Newton's second law is crucial in understanding and predicting the motion of objects under various forces, forming the cornerstone of classical mechanics.","languages":["en"],"lengthWords":249}

You've got Sheldon, who's a genius but has zero social skills, and his roommate Leonard, who's also really smart but a bit more normal. They hang out with their friends Raj and Howard, and they all have these funny, geeky adventures. Then there's Penny, their neighbor, who's not a scientist but adds a lot of humor and heart to the mix. The show is packed with nerdy jokes, comic book references, and a lot of awkward but endearing moments. It's a blast watching these characters navigate friendships, relationships, and their careers while staying true to their geeky roots.","languages":["en"],"lengthWords":115}
